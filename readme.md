# QA Weekly Renamer
## The Problem:
Adam Gola - [Szkolenie dla QA] (https://szkoleniedlaqa.pl) - distributes its QA Weekly by mail, but you can also buy the archive. However, the archive is accessible as HTML files with wrong names, like **w8x2f1l5v6.htm**.
## The Purpose:
The script renames the files in input folder according to found issue number and saves them in output folder
## Notes:
I don't share input and output folders, as they contain files you have to buy from Adam. Of course, you can also subsribe his free newsletter with QA Weekly (in Polish)
